This module produces colorized and HTML escaped code from
HTML::Mason source suitable for displaying on the WWW and
perhaps even in an Mason environment.  Lots of things are
customizable, but the defaults are pretty reasonable.


SYNOPSIS

  use Syntax::Highlight::Mason;
  use IO::All;
  my $compiler = Syntax::Highlight::Mason->new();
  while (my $file = shift @ARGV) {
    my $source < io($file);
    print $compiler->compile($source);
  }

Also, take a look at:

eg/view_source.html

which is an HTML::Mason component that adds a view source option
to any file based component into which it is added.
